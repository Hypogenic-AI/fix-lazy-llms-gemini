  title: Fixing Lazy LLMs
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: 'Large language models (LLMs) tend to prefer easy or less effortful
    responses due to a lack of subjective judgment of good or bad. Prompting LLMs
    to act as harsher critics and controlling the response budget may reduce this
    "laziness" and improve output quality. This research will test whether such prompting
    strategies are effective and explore alternative approaches.

    '
  background:
    description: 'Colloquially, I have heard complaints that LLMs are lazy. They kind
      of prefer to take the easy way out without trying very hard. It is also hypothesized
      that being rude to LLMs leads to better results.

      I think the main reason for this is that LLMs do not have subjective judgement
      of good or bad. A simple approach would be to ask it to be a harsher and harsher
      critic and control the budget.

      Does this approach work? Are there other approaches?'
